Description: Distributed HTTP and websocket proxy
 Hipache is a distributed proxy designed to route high volumes of http and
 websocket traffic to unusually large numbers of virtual hosts, in a highly
 dynamic topology where backends are added and removed several times per second.
 It is particularly well-suited for PaaS (platform-as-a-service) and other
 environments that are both business-critical and multi-tenant.
 .
 Hipache was originally developed at dotCloud, a popular platform-as-a-service,
 to replace its first-generation routing layer based on a heavily instrumented
 nginx deployment. It currently serves production traffic for tens of thousands
 of applications hosted on dotCloud. Hipache is based on the node-http-proxy
 library.
